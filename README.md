No explicit testing suite

####any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)

All XML files are stored in the data folder.

####any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)

Not particularly, the UI should be straightforward

####any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality

Yilun: None in simulation and IO part, to the best of my knowledge.

The line graph does not reflect accurate cell counts at times.

####any extra features included in the project

Yilun: no extra features outside of the extensions. For extension, I implemented feature 1 and 3 of Simulation, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Configuration.

####your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future

Yilun: I like this project, but I think specifications (expecially those extensions) can be more clear, since I sometimes need to ask TA what a requirement means.
